## A Redis database clone made using C to challenge myself to learn more about the language

This project was made to test my knowledge of C by creating a clone of something I use a lot. 
I might keep optimizing and implementing features to it as time goes on.

The current state of this application is actually **reasonable for production use and cross-platform (Windows and Unix)**.
